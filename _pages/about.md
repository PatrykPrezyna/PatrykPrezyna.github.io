I have a deep passion for exploring and understanding the world—whether it's the history of cities, political systems, or the latest advancements in technology.

One of my key interests lies in the concept of Democratizing Systems Engineering. I am particularly focused on leveraging and developing open-source tools to make the design and development of complex systems more accessible. My mission is to ensure that systems engineering remains inclusive, avoiding unnecessary specialization or exclusivity.

Beyond my professional pursuits, I enjoy applying systems thinking to both personal life and broader societal challenges. I believe this approach can bring clarity and innovative solutions to complex problems.

In my free time, I channel my creativity into developing games for my family — a fun way to combine learning, problem-solving, and connection.
